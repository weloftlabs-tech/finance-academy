	<b>DO YOU KNOW YOUR BUSINESS NUMBERS?</b>
	</p>
	<p>In business, numbers are everything. Numbers, and only numbers, tell you if your business is making a profit or a loss. Numbers are the scoreboard, and the scoreboard is how you measure success.
</p>
<p>
If you don’t keep score, your business will run into financial trouble. 60% of businesses don’t make it into their second year. The Finance Academy researched hundreds of failed businesses in Australia. What they all had in common was poor financial management.
</p>
<p>
Business finance is all about common sense – something that’s not very common these days. If you make decisions based on “what feels right” or “what’s convenient,” you are making decisions based on assumption. 
</p>
<p>Making business decisions affects the bottom line. Would you rather: Make blind choices? Or profitable decisions based on facts and evidence?
</p>
<p>Chinmay has personally trained hundreds of small business owners to Know Numbers. Through his easy to understand and easy to follow online videos, book, and personal one-on-one sessions, they have learned about the most common finance mistakes and how to avoid them – every time.</p>
