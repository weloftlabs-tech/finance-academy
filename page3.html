<p><b>WHO IS A FINANCE PERSON IN YOUR ORGANISATION?</b></p>
<p>In your organisation, can you tell who the finance person is?</p>

<p>Is it your:</p>

<ol>
<li>Human resources manager?</li>
<li>Your administration officer?</li>
<li>Your salesperson?</li>
<li>Your marketing manager?</li>
<li>The IT officer?</li>
<li>Project manager?</li>
</ol>

<p>Or is just the person with “finance” in their job title? </p>


<p><b>If you’re in part of an organisation, you are a finance person</b></p>
<p>The biggest myth in business today is that only the people trained in finance are finance people; people like your finance controllers, accountants or CFOs.</p>

<p>Managers and employees in a large to enterprise organisation all contribute to the bottom line – front-line workers, supervisors, middle managers and executives – they are all finance people.</p>

<p>Though you may not have ‘finance’ in your job title, if you work to make a company profit, you are a finance person.</p>

<p>The Finance Academy’s Mastery program is 100% formulated in conjunction with management, resulting in a comprehensive finance education course that is unique to your business and your objectives.</p>

<p>Throughout the sessions, designed in part by you and your objectives, your team will learn all the basics covered in the Know Numbers and Know More Numbers program. Your team gains personal access to Chinmay’s wealth of financial knowledge and education during in-house sessions and seminars conducted by Chinmay himself.</p>

<p>Throughout your customised and focused sessions, Chinmay helps your team:</p>
<ol>
