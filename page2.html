	<b>FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING – IS THERE A DIFFERENCE?</b>
	</p>
	<p>Think about it – is there a difference between business finance and business accounting?</p>

	<p>Do you know what that difference is?</p>

	<p>Knowing the difference can make all the difference when it comes to making profitable decisions.</p>
<p>
<b>A Referee Can’t Kick The Ball – Your Accountant Can’t Make You Profit</b>
</p>
<p>
As part of the Finance Academy’s advanced program, Know More Numbers, medium to large businesses learn the critical difference between finance and accounting.</p>

<p>In football, you have your team; and you have a referee keeping everyone honest and playing by the rules.</p>

<p>In business, you have your company and you have an accountant, keeping your books in line. You pay an accountant to ensure your company is diligent in its record keeping and reporting.</p>

<p>A referee does not interfere with the game in progress – they can’t kick the ball on your behalf. So why are you expecting your accountant to make you profit?</p>
<p>Know More Numbers is a fully tailored course teaching you:
<ol>
<li>How to read your financial statements</li>
<li>Whether your business is making profit</li>
<li>What happens to your profits</li>
<li>How to properly evaluate risks</li>
<li>How you can empower your team by giving them guidance around numbers, finance and accounting</li>
<li>Skills to discover business ‘patterns’</li>
<li>How to make business simple.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>Know More Numbers is the Finance Academy’s advanced program. Though covering more ground, Chinmay’s lessons are free of jargon, are enlightening and eye opening.</p>

<p>Chinmay sits down with you and analyses your financial reports. The results are relevant to your business and your business alone. You and Chinmay take a detailed look at your Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss statements and your other financial “scoreboards” showing you the health and vitality of your business.</p>

<p>Chinmay conducts all the one-on-one or team sessions, comprised of 4 x 3-4hr sessions and/or 8 x 3-4hr sessions.</p>

<p>Chinmay can travel to you, wherever you are in Australia. Overseas? Join Chinmay in a private online video conference session. Learn at your own pace with a host of online materials including videos, webinars and books.</p>
